Are you joking?&nbsp; There are people who believe the world is flat?&nbsp; It's hard to believe at first in this day and age, but they're out there.&nbsp;&nbsp; While they may be a bit out there and lean disturbingly in the direction of paranoia it brings attention to a significant fact of life that's becoming more and more poignant.&nbsp; How do you really know what's true?<br><br>If you're like me all the evidence you have about the shape of the world is second-hand knowledge from things learned in school and reinforced by all the people around you with the same background.&nbsp; Granted it takes a little more mental gymnastics to deal with details such as the Earth rising pictures from Apollo and the space station, and while unlikely, I have nothing in my direct experience to confirm or refute that they're fake.<br><br>With the way that modern media is moving, a sense of skepticism about what we know becomes an increasingly healthy attitude as different broadcasters and information outlets make little effort to hide their prejudices and the spin given to their choice of stories and coverage of those stories.<br><br>As we shift our attention from worldly affairs inward to our spiritual life, this attitude becomes even more important.&nbsp; Collectively as we outgrow many of the beliefs that once made sense for us, from men as God-anointed authoritarian leaders of a household to the need to procreate ad infinitum, the state of the world has changed to make it clear they are no longer appropriate.&nbsp; While many people today can easily see through these as merely beliefs, how many beliefs do you hold without realizing that you take them for granted?&nbsp; This is a fundamental element of spiritual life; to be able to distinguish between what is real and what is merely a belief inherited blindly and reinforced by those around you.&nbsp; Even the openness to look and question is an act of spiritual courage.&nbsp; To actually experiment to try to determine what is true is to have your feet solidly on the path and this is the piece that I believe the flat-earthers miss.&nbsp; They have taken to heart the valuable pursuit of deeply questioning what they've been taught but they pursue no means to validate or invalidate the theory they choose to replace the previous belief with.&nbsp; I do feel that they are opting for this new theory not out of an honest appraisal, but as an alternative to acknowledging that they really don't know. &nbsp;&nbsp; I don't feel like I'm in a position to critisize them strongly for that though, as I've never done anything to check the shape of the Earth.&nbsp; but I expect the next time I'm near a major port I'll borrow some binoculars and see for myself if the ship sailing away really sinks or slowly shrinks as it heads out into the open ocean.<br><br>It's with this attitude that I suggest you contemplate who you are and your place in the world, taking the answers you find and starting with questions like \"Is it really true?\" and \"What could I do to check if it's true?\"</span><br><br>Ultimately, much of this leads to great uncertainty where previously there was no acknowledged doubt, and this is where real spiritual courage is needed, to deeply acknowledge and live in peace with the great undeniable truth of uncertainty.<br><br>\r\n</div>", "pub_time": "2018-01-03T19:54:00Z"}}, {"model": "meditate.reflection", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Ascension Paths -- Ponzi Schemes of the Subtle World?", "title_slug": "ascension-paths-ponzi-schemes-of-the-subtle-world", "content": "<div class=\"paragraph\">\r\nTo ascend into the heavens.&nbsp; To rise above it all.&nbsp; To raise your energy and embody your higher self.&nbsp; Who would argue with any of these aims?<br><br>If you think that angels, spirits, ghosts, dragons (Chinese), subtle beings, the human soul, are all a bunch of superstitious nonsense then you're probably pretty skeptical regarding ascension paths and the following discussion won't add anything to your perspective.&nbsp; However, for those who've had experiences suggesting there is some reality behind these concepts it pays to look more closely at what you're trying to accomplish through an ascension path, and what you might actually accomplish.<br><br>Ascension paths are described in different ways, but center around raising your (insert \"mind\", \"consciousness\", \"energy\", \"spirit\", depending on path) to a better state, or taking ownership of that better state that already exists and simply is neglected from your current position.&nbsp; Through practice (usually of secret techniques \"shared only with a few\") you can transform yourself, improving your life and the lives of those around you by cultivating this higher (wiser, more intelligent, more loving, more creative) self.<br><br>If that was the end of it, it would be a great idea.&nbsp; What significant problem would there be with making a conscious effort to align yourself with greater wisdom, love, clarity, etc?&nbsp; In this form it is a valuable spiritual path, how then can it go wrong?<br><br>There are a couple of ways it can divert you from your true path.&nbsp; One of the most unfortunate is through misplaced trust.&nbsp; Some people make contact with a subtle being of some sort and because of the novelty of the experience presume they can trust it and believe whatever it communicates to them.&nbsp; The unfortunate truth is that much like people, subtle beings come in many different flavors and with many different motives.&nbsp; There's nothing to stop a random spirit from claiming to be your higher self and guide you to do things in its interest rather than yours.<br><br>This misplaced trust can also be in the form of a human teacher who draws on the energy of his/her students to raise themselves and use their perspective to guide you.&nbsp; A useful technique if they are also learning from your discoveries and come to be a companion on your path rather than exclusively a leader.&nbsp; The trouble comes when the path is of their taking a new level with their students taking up the role&nbsp; they vacated and recruiting new students to fill their previous role.&nbsp; A telltale symptom of a questionable teaching is an increasing importance or speed in achieving new levels; the mind is constantly pushed toward an ever-brighter future, distracting it from the reality of what is happening now.<br><br>When we follow this energetic pattern through to its conclusion its easy to see the problem.&nbsp; Even if it was the most perfect teaching and there was no objection to its spread, eventually the energetic pyramid would have no more base stones (new students) to set and everyone would be stuck at their current level.&nbsp; The promise, explicit or implicit, of continual growth would be broken.&nbsp; History shows us many examples of what happens next through the sectarian conflicts that have raged in hierarchal religions.&nbsp; When we look closely at the subtle beings that would contribute to a system like this; raising energy up from human beings to strengthen subtle beings knowing that most adherents won't achieve the promises made, it isn't that hard to qualify them.&nbsp; In social circumstances it would be obvious that they were fraudsters, in a biological context, parasites.<br><br>So what is one to do?&nbsp; Cower in fear in the nearest spiritual sanctuary?&nbsp; Dump the exploration of the subtle world altogether and chase money?&nbsp; Of course not, and by keeping a few things in mind one can generally avoid the less wholesome guides.&nbsp; First and foremost, be very honest with yourself particularly regarding your motives.&nbsp; The greatest deceptions you will suffer from others must have the ground prepared for them by hiding things from yourself.&nbsp; Second, be cautious of guides, physical or subtle, which object to questions.&nbsp; Brief periods of taking something from your guide for granted to test for yourself its efficacy are entirely normal when learning something new.&nbsp; If you see impatience or even anger from a guide when you voice skepticism, know these are symptoms of a teaching built on belief rather than knowledge.&nbsp; If you have concerns or doubts, face them, don't brush them aside.&nbsp; If that means leaving a guide, trust your own wisdom enough to do so.<br><br>Remember that you're embarking on a journey of not only learning, but discovery.&nbsp; Just as with all human endeavors there is a great deal that a fresh pair of eyes (aka beginner's mind) can reveal.&nbsp; Your true place is going to include sharing the insights that come to you, not only accepting the insights that have come to others.<br><br>\r\n</div>", "pub_time": "2018-01-31T10:14:00Z"}}, {"model": "meditate.reflection", "pk": 3, "fields": {"title": "The Power of Retreat", "title_slug": "the-power-of-retreat", "content": "<div class=\"paragraph\">\r\nEven if you aren't living one of the crazy-paced modern lifestyles we're regulary told has become \"normal\", the value and power of a spiritual retreat is tremendous.&nbsp; There is a lot to be said about spending time with a mature spiritual teacher, and in the company of others who also have their focus peeled away from the distractions of the mundane in a modern lifestyle and placed on deeper questions and more subtle aspects of experience.&nbsp; Of course there are also the powerful effects time in nature has on the more subtle aspects of our wellbeing.&nbsp; While retreat experiences can be profound sometimes it's difficult to integrate the insights from them into our daily lives, not to mention that for most of us a week or two away from work and our other responsibilities may be difficult to come by.<br><br>These things bring us to another and one of the most important benefits of retreat, the breaking of established habit.&nbsp; Mixing up our routine reveals what our habits keep hidden, and infuses the mundane aspects of our experiences with freedom and new life.&nbsp; Not only is this a tremendous benefit of retreat, but it's one that we can reap alongside our daily lives.&nbsp; I would say it's one that's important to integrate with our lives.&nbsp; The approach I propose is the solo retreat, where you continue with your worldly responsibilities but make changes in the way you spend the time that you have control over.&nbsp; A good period to start with is three days or a week where you commit to these changes and see them through, deferring evaluation of their value or benefit until the period is over.&nbsp; In preparation for the retreat, a period of time spent reflecting and/or journaling on two questions; what activities are part of my day out of habit, but have become dull or unsatisfying, and what deeply satisfying activities do I spend too little time on.&nbsp; Good examples of the first are too much time with TV, Netflix, Snapchat, Facebook, or YouTube.&nbsp; These are activities that people often fall into out of habit for distraction rather than a true satisfaction and make the case for a media fast as part of your retreat.&nbsp; Good examples of the second are topics you'd like to investigate more deeply through reading or a class, tending to your relationship with your body through outdoor activity, yoga, qigong, or even simply taking the extra time to learn to cook a new dish and enjoying a home-cooked meal...and of course taking additional time for spiritual reading and meditation are options I strongly encourage.<br><br>While your reflection should make it clear the specifics of your retreat, much of the value is simply cutting away of the immense collection of distractions we accumulate in our routine.&nbsp; This frees us up to witness what's going on under the surface and if maintained, puts us in touch with what would be more deeply satisfying.&nbsp; There is of course the possible discomfort of unpleasant experiences coming to the surface, but while we may want to avoid these in the short term taking the time to witness them and derive insights from a greater familiarity will at least inform our means of coping with them and often will provide the necessary insight to release and resolve them.<br><br>Focusing your attention on what you find more deeply satisfying has obvious benefits.&nbsp; For whatever reason, among the responsibilities we have, we drift from these things.&nbsp; Sometimes this is due to changes in interest and priorities, but often a period of focusing on getting back in touch with them will remind us of the great enjoyment we take in them.&nbsp; When we taste that enjoyment fresh again, it becomes much easier to prevent them from drifting when the retreat is over.<br><br>While I call it a \"solo\" retreat and often it will be, pulling in compatriots to join you will be valuable and enriching.&nbsp; For those with discipline trouble having others involved will help you keep your commitment.&nbsp; There's also a synergistic effect when a small group focus on the same items.&nbsp; Meeting up in-person is ideal, but plenty of benefit can still be reaped by connecting over social media, or platforms like Insight Timer.<br><br>For those that run with this please let me know how it goes, I'd love to hear your experience.<br><br>\r\n</div>", "pub_time": "2018-03-12T19:59:00Z"}}, {"model": "meditate.reflection", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "Turning Toward Darkness", "title_slug": "turning-toward-darkness", "content": "<div class=\"paragraph\">\r\nNo, I'm not Darth Vader trying to turn you to the dark side, or some demonic agent trying to convert you to Lucifer's ranks.  Most of us avoid the darkness in our lives not through a guiding wisdom that carries us through the light, but out of an attitude much like that of the ostrich burying its head in the sand.  This approach lets problems build, adding to the difficulties that we and those around us face. I'm suggesting taking a clear look at what's happening in your life, the bad as well as the good.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWe all have rough days and for that matter, rough longer stretches.  How we deal with them colors to a great extent their images when they return again in the future.  Coping strategies abound and of course they have a place to make our difficulties tolerable.  Coping based on escape can become a trap of its own though.  Escape comes in many forms. Distraction via media is a front-runner today.  Excessive use of alcohol and other substances are old standbys, but some can be fairly innocuous in appearance. Putting in extra time on work projects, or diving into a hobby.  Even the oft-encouraged talking about your problems can be used as a way to avoid facing them.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhile there are perks and drawbacks to all of these, the real measure of a coping strategy is not how much harm it does to you or even how much better it makes you feel, but is how you use it.  After diving into your escape and feeling better do you emit a sigh of relief and go back to life as usual or do you revisit the crisis, big or small that sent you into it?  As much as it can help to share your problems with others, a time will come when what you are facing is simply outside of the understanding of those around you.  In addition, people are pretty frazzled and few have the resources to really go into another problem.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThese moments when no one is there for you are the wake up call that you have been spreading the darkness around, but not actually doing anything about cleaning it up.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt's a rude and terrifying wake-up call, and one that doesn't need to come if time is spent regularly in attending to your inner life, what some would refer to as subjective experience or the subtle world; the portions of your experience that don't come to you through your senses.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnd here is where your well-honed coping mechanisms can work for you.  First, do your best to identify your coping mechanisms.  It might not be obvious at first.  Good areas to look are \"default\" activities that you just fall into when you're not otherwise engaged.  Activities that you spend a lot of time in, but aren't particularly satisfying and don't have a clear practical aim are also ones to be suspicious of.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOnce you've identified some suspects, check yourself whenever they come up; What is your inner experience?  Check the various areas of thought, emotion, and bodily sensation and identify anything active that you have an aversion to.  If you don't find any, you probably just need a new hobby, but if (when) you find something you're averse to in that moment, spend some time getting to know it without trying to change it.  Just giving it your attention, allowing it to appear instead of suppressing it will result in changes for you to see.  If it becomes too intense, stop and use your coping mechanism to return to a tolerable state.  You can either return after it has subsided some or let it go and continue when it revisits you.  In this way you can use your coping skills not just as a way to hide from difficulties, but to make you feel safe in approaching what may at first seem overwhelming or insurmountable in order to actually resolve them.\r\n</div>", "pub_time": "2018-04-11T16:37:01Z"}}]
