    <p>So you’ve gotten a chance to check in to see what is motivating you to meditate. Now I’d like you to set those motivations and aims aside. There’s no need to suppress or avoid them just don’t work to realize them. Treat them with indifference and simply do the practice.</p>

    <p>This simple practice is found across spiritual traditions. There are two main facets to meditative practices and the Indian traditions have two different words for them which are both often translated as “meditation” Dharana is more appropriately translated as concentration and Dhyana which can be translated as meditation or contemplation. Christian traditions often use the term contemplation or contemplative prayer for the first and meditation for the second. In Taoism the first type is regularly used in bodily practices with the second as meditative practice and as a background to the first. The practice I present here develops both of these facets.</p>

    <p>There is also a third form of meditative practice known as Bakti (devotion) in Indian traditions or affective prayer in Judeo-Christian traditions. Because this form of meditative practice involves the worship of a deity and I’d like to present a practice that doesn’t require the adoption of any religious beliefs, I’m going to leave it aside here.</p>

    <p>Let’s get started. Sit down in a comfortable manner on a rug, mat, or cushion. If this isn’t comfortable for you sit in a chair or on the edge of your bed. If you use a chair move forward some so that your spine is supporting the torso instead of the chair’s backrest.</p>

    <p>Gently straighten your spine. It can be helpful to imagine a golden thread attached to the top of the head gently pulling the head upward and let the weight of the body flow down into the earth through your cushion. Now gently place your attention on your breath and neither encourage nor engage any thoughts that appear. Simply let them waft in and out like leaves blowing past a window, let them pass by like ripples on a pond. After some time you will notice that a stream of thought has captured your attention and you’ve forgotten about the breath. This moment of noticing is the real substance of this practice. When it occurs, simply place your attention on the breath and continue. Don’t try to forcefully hold your attention on the breath. This will interfere with the practice and build up tension in the body. A gentle placement of the attention on the breath each time you find yourself distracted by thought is all that’s needed. At these moments of noticing see also if your posture needs restoring.</p>

    <p>As simple as it is, the elements of focused attention and uninvolved observation you experience through this practice are the foundation of the tremendous variety of meditative techniques that exist. While during this course you will sample some of the techniques which build upon this, it alone can be used for insightful investigation and transformation all by itself. Make the time for it and see for yourself what happens.</p>

        For your meditation journal, write about the one or two things which stand out the most for you from the session. It could be about the thoughts themselves or something else. Also take note of how often you wake up to distraction and how long it is between these moments.
